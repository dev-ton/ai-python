There was once a hare who was friends with a tortoise. One day, he challenged the tortoise to a race. \
Seeing how slow the tortoise was going, the hare thought heâ€™ll win this easily. So he took a nap while the tortoise kept on going. \
When the hare woke up, he saw that the tortoise was already at the finish line. \
Much to his chagrin, the tortoise won the race while he was busy sleeping.
